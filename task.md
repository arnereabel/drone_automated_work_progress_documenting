# Tello Drone Photography System for Steel Structure Documentation

## Planning Phase
- [x] Requirements gathering discussion
- [x] Define MVP scope (3 stops, 10m apart)
- [x] Define detection strategy (QR codes)
- [x] Define photo strategy (3 angles per stop)
- [x] Define safety features (crossed arms emergency, obstacle avoidance)
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] User review and approval

## Implementation Phase
- [x] Project setup and dependencies
- [x] Core modules:
  - [x] Flight Navigator (waypoint navigation)
  - [x] QR Detector (structure identification)
  - [x] Photo Capture (multi-angle with storage)
  - [x] Safety Module (obstacle avoidance + hand gesture)
  - [x] Main Controller (state machine orchestration)
- [x] Configuration system
- [x] Testing utilities

## Verification Phase
- [x] Unit tests for each module (17 passed)
- [x] Integration testing with drone simulator
- [ ] Real drone test with single waypoint
- [ ] Full MVP test (3 waypoints)
