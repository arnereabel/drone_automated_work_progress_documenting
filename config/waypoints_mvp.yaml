# MVP Waypoint Configuration
# 3 stopping points, 10m apart along X axis

# Coordinates are relative to takeoff point (in centimeters)
# Tello coordinate system:
#   X = forward/backward
#   Y = left/right  
#   Z = up/down (height)

waypoints:
  - name: "Stop 1"
    x: 0
    y: 0
    z: 100  # 1m height
    description: "First structure checkpoint"

  - name: "Stop 2"
    x: 1000  # 10m forward
    y: 0
    z: 100
    description: "Second structure checkpoint"

  - name: "Stop 3"
    x: 2000  # 20m forward
    y: 0
    z: 100
